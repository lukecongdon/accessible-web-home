# Accessible Web Home

The purpose of this project is to create a browser home page for persons with physical mobility challenges which prevents fine motor link clicking or typing-based web browsing. This home page displays saved links as large, clickable tiles which opens links in new browser tabs or windows. 

## Goals
* Create a home page for mobility-impaired persons with large, easy to click link targets
* Allow user to get to desired pages easily without typing. Some use of a track pad or mouse is expected. 
* Allow, possibly with assistance, the saving of additional new links on-demand
* Allow, possibly with assistance, the deletion of unwanted links on-demand 

## Features
* Expandable top banner for the input of a URL and a short nickname for display.
* Tiles per link which open in new tabs/windows according to browser set-up
* Addition of new links, or deletion of existing links

## Notes
* The initial use of this page expects the aid of someone to create a Firebase account and update the project.js file with the new identification data.
* Use of the current Firebase configuration is not encouraged since it is forceably shared and not private.
* The initial input of URLs may require assistance as it requires finer motor skills than browsing, which is the expected daily use case.
* Deleting blocks uses small delete trash can icons. These too may need help to use. 
* This is a student project which exercised JavaScript for learning purposes. Not every aspect of mobility limititation has been addressed.
